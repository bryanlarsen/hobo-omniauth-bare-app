This is a bare Hobo app that has VERY rudimentary omniauth support.

To use:

1) sign up for twitter app access:  https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new

2) put the keys into config/initializers/omniauth.rb

3) start your app, and then go to /auth/twitter.  This will create a
new user, add twitter authorization to the current user and/or log the
user in.
